# full-stack-challenge

Hello! Welcome to the Balanced take-home coding challenge.

This is a full-stack exercise that involves building a UI to a given design spec and making building a simple API backend. This should take no more than 4 hours to implement the feature, but we'll emphasize that there's no clock ticking on your implementation. Do this at your own working pace. If you decide to break it up over multiple coding sessions, that's fine too.

Also keep in mind there is no upper bound on the time you spend on this project, so if you'd like to use this as an opportunity to learn a new library or technology, or just make the project better in general you should definitely feel free to do so!

Feel free to use any language, component library, framework, or setup you would like. For reference, we use Nextjs, NodeJS Typescript, GraphQL, and Postgres. You are not required to use that stack. Me personally, I love Go and Vue. We just want to know you can be flexible and learn!

## Frontend

Please build a UI that properly presents the given design. (hint try to be mobile first!).

This exercise we want to see your ability to build scalable UI components given a dataset.

## API

You will find a json file called `data.json`. This is the data that you should use to build your simple API Endpoint. The endpoint just has to return the set data. (hint you can alter this data but each item in the list represents a row in a DB table.)
