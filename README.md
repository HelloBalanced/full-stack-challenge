# full-stack-challenge

Hello! Welcome to the Balanced take-home coding challenge.

This full-stack exercise will involve building a simple live schedule application. We do not expect you spend an entire weekend on this exercise. Do this at your own pace. If you decide to break it up over multiple coding sessions, that's fine too. We figure about 4 hours of work.

Also, keep in mind there is no upper bound on the time you spend on this project, so if you'd like to use this as an opportunity to learn a new library or technology or make the project better in general, you should feel free to do so!

Feel free to use any language, component library, framework, or set up you would like. You are not required to use our current tech stack (Nextjs, NodeJS Typescript, GraphQL, and Postgres). As a reference, we love Go and Vue. We want to know you can be flexible, learn, and use the right tool for the job!

## Requirements

Build a web application that will display the information from `data.json.`

1. Build a web application

- Create a page that routes to `/.`
- Display the data from the given data.json
- Style list of data to the given design spec.

2. API endpoints

- Create an API Endpoint that will list all of the given data from `data.json.`
- Create an API Endpoint that will allow someone to insert a new schedule into the given `data.json` dataset.

## Notes:

- Treat this like a production-grade repository.
- Include proper and relevant documentation to better help us understand your solution.

## Submitting your work!

Please commit all of your work to the main branch‚ùó

When you have finished the exercise, please create a bundle of your work by running the bundle script (bundle.sh) in the directory's root.

The bundle script will create a bundle file called balance-full-stack-challenge.bundle based on your local main branch. Send the file to us via email, or if you received a submission link from your hiring manager, please upload it there.

Thank you and good luck!
